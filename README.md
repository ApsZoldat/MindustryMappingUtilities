Small Mindustry mod improving map editor convenience and possibilities

**Maps created with this mod are fully compatible with vanilla**

## Improvements:

* **More Rules Available**: Reveals some hidden vanilla map rules *(Custom Mode Name, Unit Posession Allowed, Show Enemy Spawns, etc.)*
* **Planet Background**: Allows to edit planet background rendered on map *(yes, it's still just hidden vanilla features)*

**⚠️ Work In Progress ⚠️**
More map making tools will be added in future
