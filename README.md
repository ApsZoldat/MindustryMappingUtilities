# Small Mindustry mod improving map editor convenience and possibilities

> This is an enhanced remake of old Mapping Utilities, however, it's WIP, so it has way less features yet. When this mod will contain all features of old version, the old version will be removed from mod browser and completely replaced by this one.


**Maps created with this mod are fully compatible with vanilla**

## Improvements:

* **More Rules Available**: Reveals some hidden vanilla map rules *(Custom Mode Name, Unit Possession Allowed, Show Enemy Spawns, etc.)*
* **Planet Background**: Allows to edit planet background rendered on map *(yes, it's still just hidden vanilla features)*

**⚠️ Work In Progress ⚠️**
More map making tools will be added in future
