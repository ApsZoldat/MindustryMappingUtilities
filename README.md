# Small Mindustry mod improving map editor convenience and possibilities

> This is an enhanced remake of old Mapping Utilities, however, it's WIP, so it has way less features yet. Currently i am trying to implement some acceptable old mod's features into vanilla through pull requests, but the all the controversial features and bypasses will remain a part of this mod.


**Maps created with this mod are fully compatible with vanilla Mindustry**

## Improvements:

* **More Rules Available**: Reveals some hidden vanilla map rules *(Custom Mode Name, Unit Possession Allowed, Show Enemy Spawns, etc.)*
* **Planet Background**: Allows to edit planet background rendered on map *(yes, it's still just hidden vanilla features)*
* **Map Size Bypass**: New map size limits are 1-2147483647. Abusing this can easily crash your game, so have fun

**⚠️ Work In Progress ⚠️**
More map making tools will be added in future
