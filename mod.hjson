    > This is an enhanced remake of old Mapping Utilities, however, it's WIP, so it has way less features yet. Currently i am trying to implement some acceptable old mod's features into vanilla through pull requests, but the all the controversial features and bypasses will remain a part of this mod.


    Small Mindustry mod improving map editor convenience and possibilities
    Maps created with this mod are fully compatible with vanilla


    Improvements:

    - More Rules Available
    - Planet Background Editing
    - Map Size bypass


    Check README.md in GitHub repo for more detailed information about these features

    ! Work In Progress !
    More map making tools will be added in future
